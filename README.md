# COVID-19 or Pneumonia?
### Automated Detection of Possible COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks with X-Ray Images

A deep learning model is proposed for the automatic diagnosis of Pneumonia in which could be a sign of COVID-19. The proposed model was developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (Pneumonia, Possibly COVID-19 vs. No-Findings). My model produced an average classification accuracy of 94.08% for binary classes. 

The [ChestX-ray8 database](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) provided by Wang et al. was used for normal and pneumonia images. In order to avoid the unbalanced data problem, I used 500 no-findings and 500 pneumonia class frontal chest X-ray images randomly from this database. Please see the inspiration [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340935440_Automated_Detection_of_COVID-19_Cases_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_X-ray_Images) for the details.
